Customers began to leave a bank. It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not in order to keep current customers. 

**Project Objectives**

- Analyze data on the behavior of bank customers, termination of contracts. 
- Predict the exit of the client from the bank.
- Build classification model, quality metric f1 (minimum value 0.59)
- Measure AUC-ROC, compare its value with f1-measure.

**Stages**

- Data preprocessing
- Building Classification Models
- Elimination class imbalance
- Model testing, calculation of f1 and ROC_AUC metrics

**Tools** 

Pandas, Sklearn, Numpy
