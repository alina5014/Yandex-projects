- Analyze data and prepare it for further 
- Calculate efficiency
- Determine the concentration of the gold, silver, lead during different stages
- Build a machine learning model 
- Calculate SMAPE

**Stages**

- Data overview
- Data preparation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Building and training the model.
- Profit and Risk Calculation

**Tools** 

Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn
